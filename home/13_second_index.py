# Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims".
# It’s easy to find its first occurrence with a function index or find which will point out that "s" is the first
# symbol in a word "sims" and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the second "s"
# which is 4th in a row and that means that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.
#
# Input: Two strings.
#
# Output: Int or None
